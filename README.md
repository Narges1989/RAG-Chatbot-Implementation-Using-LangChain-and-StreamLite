Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative AI models to enhance response accuracy and contextual understanding. Unlike traditional language models that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG dynamically retrieves relevant information from external sources, such as databases, documents, or APIs, before generating a response.

This method is particularly useful in scenarios where up-to-date, domain-specific, or factual accuracy is required, such as customer support, research assistance, and knowledge-based applications. By integrating retrieval with generation, RAG enables AI systems to provide more informed, context-aware, and precise answers, reducing hallucinations and improving reliability.
